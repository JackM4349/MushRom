# MushRom
An Unfinished SMW Rom Editor


HEY THERE!!!
So, if you're reading this, let me explain whats going on...

Mushrom is -you guessed it- an unfinished rom hacking tool for SMW.
It was 87% complete, but the assets and phew snippets of data weren't 
imported in time.
And if you guessed it, theres no executable.
If you want to compile it yourself- Which is most likely what you'll have to do,
feel free to!
If you want to help work on the project, send me a friend request on discord
at "@Jexiled#5259"

Without quotes: Jexiled#5259

Thank you for downloading- or atleast checking out!
Ciao!
